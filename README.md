## Purpose of this repository

This is a project made by Pinja Mikkonen and Timo Tuulio for the course Software testing COMP.SE.200 in Tampere University. In this project we have planned and implemented tests for a software library. Source folder includes the code from the library and test folder includes the tests created for this assignment.

The project was made using mocha with chai. Travis CI was used for continual integration and c8 and coveralls were used to create coverage reports. After installing necessary packages the tests can be run from the main folder with command 'mocha'.


Source code folder contains a separate license file that must **NOT** be removed under any circumstances!
Removing this license file directly violates terms and conditions of the software under testing.

Individuals who remove or modify the license file will also carry the consequences.
